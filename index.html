    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player
      decides to "hold":</p><br>
    <p>• If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's
      turn.</p><br>
    <p>• If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the
      player's turn continues.</p><br>
    <p>• If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's
      turn.</p><br>
    <p>• The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p><br>
    <p>For example, the first player, Nimo begins a turn with a roll of 5. Nimo could hold and score 5 points,
      but chooses to roll again. Nimo rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to
      roll again. Nimo rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Shiro, rolls the
      sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.</p>
